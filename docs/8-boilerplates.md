# Boilerplates

When starting projects, use the boilerplates for [Gatsby apps](https://github.com/escaladesports/gatsby-boilerplate), [serverless functions](https://github.com/escaladesports/serverless-aws-boilerplate), [React components](https://github.com/escaladesports/react-component-boilerplate), and [JavaScript modules](https://github.com/escaladesports/javascript-module-boilerplate). By starting with a boilerplate, you won't need to configure Webpack or any other build tools.

They all work the same:

- `yarn dev`: Runs a local dev server (for everything except serverless functions)
- `yarn build`: Builds files for distribution
- `yarn test`: Runs unit tests (for everything except Gatsby apps)
