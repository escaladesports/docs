# Libraries/Frameworks

## React.js

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is used for the front end in all of our applications. We use the [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) extension for markup and [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) for styling.

## Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator we use to build our applications. It combines React.js with GraphQL. Using Gatsby we can easily have server side rendering in our React application.

## Serverless Framework

The [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/) is used to create and deploy APIs and functions.

## MongoDB

Typically data is stored through Git-based systems like markdown or JSON files. It's rare that we need anything more than that, but when we do [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is the preferred option.
